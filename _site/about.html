<h1>The Company</h1>

<p>
Founded in 2010, BAM Prototypes specializes in assembling quick-turn prototype pcb's.
The company was started by three engineers and aims to serve engineers.
We are committed to doing 100% error-free work and to deliver on time.
</p>
<p>
We can handle both SMT and through-hole components, as well as mixed designs.
We welcome low and mid-volume jobs which we turn around quickly at reasonable prices.
We offer a full range of services: from full turn-key to all consignment, and everything in-between.
For recurring production orders we support additional services such as electrical testing, conformal coating, potting, and mechanical assembly.
</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, we opened a new production facility in Romania.
We continue to support our existing customers in the USA, as well as welcome new customers both from Europe and the USA.
