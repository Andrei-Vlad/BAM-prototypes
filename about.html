<h1>The Company</h1>

    <p>
    Founded in 2010, BAM Prototypes specializes in assembling quick-turn prototype pcb's.
    The company was started by three engineers and aims to serve engineers.
    We are committed to doing 100% error-free work and to deliver on time.
    </p>
    <p>
    We can handle both SMT and through-hole components, as well as mixed designs.
    We welcome low and mid-volume jobs which we turn around quickly at reasonable prices.
    We offer a full range of services: from full turn-key to all consignment, and everything in-between.
    For recurring production orders we support additional services such as electrical testing, conformal coating, potting, and mechanical assembly.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of 2014, we opened a new production facility in Romania.
    We continue to support our existing customers in the USA, as well as welcome new customers both from Europe and the USA.
