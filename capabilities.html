<h1>Standard Capabilities</h1>
<table class="standard">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>PCB</th>
  <td>Rigid, flexible, and mixed; one or two sided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Components</th>
  <td>Most leaded and lead-less SMT packages. Chips down to 0402 size. All through-hole components.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Solder</th>
  <td>Lead Free and Leaded water soluble solder paste.
  <br />
  Special alloys by request.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Stencil</th>
  <td>Steel or Kapton (to reduce costs on very small jobs).</td>
</tr>

<h1>Quality</h1>
<!--p>The following checks are standard for all pcb assembly jobs:</p-->
<table class="standard"><tbody>
<!--tr>
  <th>Pre-build check</th>
  <td>A virtual build is perfomed to check components for proper fit and orientation.</td>
</tr-->
<tr>
  <th>Solder Joint</th>
  <td>All visible solder joints
are inspected for conformance to IPC-A-610E class 2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Placing</th>
    <td>Most components are machine placed, even those that come in small quantities -- for which we use our cut-tape feeders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>Reflow</th>
 <td>Reflow is performed using a vapour phase oven.
 All joints reach the proper temperature yet overheating is impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cleaning</th>
  <td>All assemblies are washed and rinsed with Deionized Water.
  Shipped units are ionically clean and ready for conformal coating.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>ESD</th>
  <td>All components are handled in an ESD controlled
environment.</td>
</tr>
